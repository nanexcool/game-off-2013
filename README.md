## Octocat Adventures!

This is a Binding of Isaac like game.

Every room gets bigger with more enemies!

Rooms CHANGE (nudge, nudge) every time you play!

Find the red door after you kill all enemies to go further down the rabbit hole!

WASD to move, ARROW KEYS to fire bullets. SPACE BAR changes all solid tiles into walkable tiles and viceversa! Keep in mind some enemies can fly!

## What I learned

* [Contributed to an open source project!](https://github.com/sq/JSIL/pull/282) - JSIL
* Used XNA to program the game, then JSIL to compile to Javascript
* Games are hard!
* Make a game, not an engine!
